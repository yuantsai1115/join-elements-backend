*Please refer to frontend repository as well to run this service. https://github.com/yuantsai1115/join-elements-frontend*

## Backgrounds
Elements in the BIM model normally have conflicts to each other during the modelling process. These conflicts affect the applications of BIM models such as the quantity take-off, or rendering. Therefore, modeller use the join function in modelling tool to merge these elements one-by-one. It is a tedious yet necessary process in AEC industry. This service automatically joins all elements in the BIM model to save a lot of time. Modeller can simply upload the model and let the server do the job, and download it back afterwards.
